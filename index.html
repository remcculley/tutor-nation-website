      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <p>
        This project aims to create an AI-powered learning platform that
        supports personalized and interactive education for students. Students
        can create profiles, complete surveys to identify their interests and
        learning goals, and receive customized lessons and practice activities
        tailored to their needs. The platform tracks student progress over time
        and adapts content based on performance and engagement.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to self-paced learning, the system supports interactive
        tutoring features such as live screen sharing, file sharing, and
        collaborative problem-solving tools to enhance real-time learning.
        Multiple user roles, including students, parents, and tutors, enable
        progress monitoring, instructional support, and secure access control,
        all within a privacy-focused and accessible learning environment.
