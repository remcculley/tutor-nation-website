            Hello! My name is August Connors, and I am a senior studying computer
            science and mathematics at the University of Alabama. I have been involved
            in UA's Quantime Lab for two years working with atomic clocks, which has
            sparked my interest in both research and precision timekeeping. I am also
            involved in a startup where I am gaining experience in full-stack and app
            development.
            <br /><br />
            In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, playing sports, and reading.
            I recently started surfing and snowboarding, which I am excited to
            continue improving at! In terms of books, I am really into sci-fi,
            with my favorite series being Dune, Ender's Game, and Project Hail Mary.

            focused on Kotlin and Express.js, where I work on backend services

            systems and production-related tools.

            Nice to meet y'all. My name is Ryan McCulley and I'm a senior computer science major
            from Memphis, Tennessee. Outside of class, I like to sing and play all kinds of sports
            with my friends. My favorite food is fried chicken and I love sweet tea. 
            <br/></br>
            Professionally, I've had experience working for an E-commerce platform development company doing QA testing
            and sales. One day, I'd like to work in Machine Learning and International Business one day. 
            Excited to work on this Project!
